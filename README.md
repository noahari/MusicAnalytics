#*THIS PROJECT IS PRESENTLY DEFUNCT*

# MusicAnalytics

## What for?
This website allows the users to input a list of songs and albums by their favorite artists, and in turn outputs an interactive parallel coordinates graph. The user can then select different lines to focus on specific data points, and selectively remove data that is less interesting to them. There is also the BANGATRON3000 component. Though it is currently disabled for frontend development, its backend implementation is complete and uses the same data points fed into a machine learning algorithm to determine whether a song is a party banger or not. This was left intentionally unpersonalizable to comply with the terms of the APIs used in this project.

## Getting Started
Simply access the website, add songs or albums to the queue, and then push the queue to the graph.
